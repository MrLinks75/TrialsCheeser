#### This can be used by both hosts and non-hosts. Hosts will see activity long before non-hosts, though.

# How To Use

1. Open app
2. Install WinPcap if requested
3. Select Device - You may need to check network adapters in Control Panel to see which one is used to connect to your WiFi/Ethernet network.
4. Ask the host of the other team to send you their IP and insert it in the red box, it should turn green.
5. Queue for Trials. The red circle will change to yellow/green depending on whether you are matched or not.

### When to change Match Threshold
* If you are not a team's host, you should set this to 0. (If you leave it above 0, yellow and green will both mean matched.)
* If the circle rapidly switches between yellow and green when you know you are matched, you may need to lower the threshold.
* If the circle rarely or never shows yellow instead of green, you may need to raise the threshold.
